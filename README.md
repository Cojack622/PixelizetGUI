## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
An open source desktop app for creating pixel art from an image input!

GUI Wrapper for [my implementation](https://github.com/Cojack622/Pixelizet) of the paper ["Pixelated image abstraction with integrated user constraints"](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Gerstner_2012_PIA/Gerstner_2012_PIA_small.pdf)

## üåü Highlights

An example of pixel art generated given an input image of the painting Under the Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai. Generated to be a 128x86 image using 12 colors in its palette.

An example of how images can be generated at varying degree of size, using a photo of Sharbat Gula (commonly entitled "Afghan Girl").

## üöÄ Usage

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bfdcd3e-35a0-49e1-8caa-f83ec34ecccb)
An image can be pixelized by pressing the "Select File" button, and uploading a PNG, JPG, or JPEG. Then, you may select your output scale and palette size. Pixelizet will then generate an pixel-art image of the given size and automatically generating a palette of the given size to use. If the image does not meet your standards, or you find the generation too slow on your PC, you can try altering some of the generation settings in "Advanced settings".

Hovering over each parameter's text will describe what it does and how changing it will affect the image. If you like the settings being used, then you can save them to a file using the "Save Settings" button, then later load them using the "Load Settings" button.
