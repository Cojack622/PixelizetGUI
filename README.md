## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
An open source desktop app for creating pixel art from an image input!

GUI Wrapper for [my implementation](https://github.com/Cojack622/Pixelizet) of the paper ["Pixelated image abstraction with integrated user constraints"](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Gerstner_2012_PIA/Gerstner_2012_PIA_small.pdf)

## üåü Highlights


### ‚úçÔ∏è Authors

GUI tool and implmentation of Pixelated Image Abstraction by Connor McGuffey.
Original Pixelization algorithm by Timothy Gerstner, Doug DeCarlo, Marc Alexa, Adam Finkelstein, Yotam Gingold, and Andrew Nealen.
GUI created using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) and Pixelization tool created using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

An image can be pixelized by pressing the "Select File" button, and uploading a PNG, JPG, or JPEG. Then, you may select your output scale and palette size. Pixelizet will then generate an pixel-art image of the given size and automatically generating a palette of the given size to use. If the image does not meet your standards, or you find the generation too slow on your PC, you can try altering some of the generation settings in "Advanced settings".

Hovering over each parameter's text will describe what it does and how changing it will affect the image. If you like the settings being used, then you can save them to a file using the "Save Settings" button, then later load them using the "Load Settings" button.
